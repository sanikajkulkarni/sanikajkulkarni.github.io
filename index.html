                    <h2>Singing</h2>
                    <p>I started singing at age four, and it has been a constant in my life. I realized in high school that it has become one of my passion. I love singing as a means to express myself, destress, and challenge myself as there is always something new to learn and improve on.</p>

                    <h2>Writing</h2>
                    <p>Writing has also become one of my favorite hobbies. After trying my hand at creative writing in school, my teachers encouraged me to continue writing even outside school. I've realized I enjoy it for the same reasons I enjoy singing; alongside those reasons, I also love how many genres and styles of writing I can explore.</p>

                    <h2>Crochet</h2>
                    <p>I began crocheting around age nine. One of my friend's moms taught me my first basic stitches. Since then, it has become one of my favorite hobbies to destress. I also love seeing how many different things I can create with it - from clothes, to stuffed animals and accessories, the posibilities are endless!</p>

                    <h2>Reading </h2>
                    <p>Reading, alongside singing, is one of the hobbies I cultivated earliest. I love being able to immerse myself in different perspectives and experience worlds I may never see in real life. Becuase of this, my favorite genres are sci-fi, mythology, and romance.</p>
